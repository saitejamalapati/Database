# Database Assignment
This project is about creating a databse schema for Restaurants Management System (RMS).<br><br>
The main aim of RMS is to store customer information, store customers order, store items available in the restaurant, etc.
We must be able to perform various operations like generate the bill for an order, find out most no. of times ordered item, etc. <br><br>
First, I developed an Entity Relationship Model for the RMS.
I figured out five different entities for RMS which are Customer, Customer_Order, Order_Details, Menu and Bill. Each entity has its own set of attributes.
The ER Model is present in the restaurants_system.pdf file.<br><br>
Later, I created five tables for the five entities and inserted some sample data.<br><br>

## I have provided five features<br><br>
### First feature is a view to print information of customer with most number of visits.<br>

### Second feature is a view to print item information which is ordered the most.<br>

### Third feature is a function to calculate the wait time of the customer with respect to timestamp of order placed.<br>

### Fourth feature is a procedure to get the latest order placed by a particular customer.<br>

### Fifth feature is a procedure to generate the bill amount for a particular order.<br><br><br>


### More features on the way!!!
